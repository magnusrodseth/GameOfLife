# Game of Life 🧬

## Description ✏️

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two
possible states, live or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight
neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the
following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

In this console application, alive cells are represented by a white circle [⚪️] and dead cells are represented by a
black circle [⚫️].

## Developer Information 🙋🏼‍♂️

Developed by Magnus Rødseth, Summer 2021.

## Running the application ✅

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `GameOfLife/cmake-build-debug` directory (bad directory name, I know...)
3. Run the `GameOfLife` executable

> ❗️ Because Game of Life is a 0-player simulation, you give the application no input. Hit CTRL+C when you're done, or simply close your terminal.
